# Linear calculations (Numbers 2)

## Task 1
A two-digit number **_n_** is given. Find its right digit (the ones digit). 


Example 

```
n = 45  result = 5
n = 80  result = 0
n = 69  result = 9
```

## Task 2
A two-digit number **_n_** is given. Find the number that was obtained after reordering the initial numbers. 


Example 

```
n = 45  result = 54
n = 80  result = 8
n = 69  result = 96
```

## Task 3
A three-digit number **_n_** is given. Find the number that was obtained by processing the initial digit from the right to the left.  


Example 

```
n = 450  result = 54
n = 807  result = 708
n = 695  result = 596
```

## Task 4
A three-digit number **_n_** is given. The first right digit was crossed out and ascribed to the left. Find the obtained number. 


Example 

```
n = 450  result = 45
n = 807  result = 780
n = 695  result = 569
```
